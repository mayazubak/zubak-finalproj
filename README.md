1. A brief (3-5 sentences) description of your planned project

My project will be an implementation of a combination of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Digit Span test. The MMSE is a series of questions that is aimed to measure cognitive impairment. Digit span is a test that measures short-term memory and working memory by testing one's ability to repeat a series of numbers in order. The MMSE is specifically designed to measure cognitve impairment in older individuals, but I believe that it can be integrated with the digit span test to be able to measure a larger range of people. 


2 a, b, c. For each of three functions, a very brief (1-2 sentences) description of what the function will do.

Function 1: generateDigits()

this function will be how the program will autopopulate numbers for the digit span aspect of this test. 

Function 2: generateShape()

one part of the MMSE is to draw a shape. Since this is an online test, I instead want to generate a shape and ask the tester to identify the shape.

Function 3: calculateScore()

this function will combine the score from the digit span test and the MMSE to display the results of the measure of cognitive function.
